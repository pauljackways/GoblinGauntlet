 changed ints to floats so that gamechangers can effect (eg: 20% reduction in flow rate) also changed doubles to floats to speed up the program (now that everything is floats)

 the function that passes player from backgroundscreencontroller to the other controllers (loadcolumn) needs to wait for setplayer to run. have added
     public void initialize() {
         if (player != null) {

         }
     }

integration issue with Ben's tower workshop and my infopane, works, but causes error on click non-tower. fix: added try-catch block that catches out of range exception and sets selectable to null. tested and works. Also noticed images weren't resetting null, so put if statement in to set null if image get is null
