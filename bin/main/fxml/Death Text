In the shadowy corners of the goblin underworld, there lived a wily creature named Grimble. His cunning and charm once made him a sought-after figure, but when his debts piled high and his promises fell empty, his fate was sealed. Betrayed by those he once called allies, Grimble found himself nailed to a makeshift cross, a stark warning to all who dared cross the boundaries of debt in the goblin community. As the sun set, casting long shadows over the desolate landscape, Grimble's cries echoed unheard, a solemn reminder of the consequences of greed and betrayal in the unforgiving world of goblins.
